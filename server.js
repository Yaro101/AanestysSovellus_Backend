// 18.11.24: Added description to dependencies for clarification and maybe useful in the presentation when explaining what we used and why
// 18.11.24: While changing password try to keep password only alphabetical because special characters need encoding this made quite a mess

// 19.11.24: Added functionalities to poll schema (created by, timestamp and datestamp and duplicate check for options)
// 19.11.24: Added validation to prevent multiple votes to pollSchema, added increment and votedBy
