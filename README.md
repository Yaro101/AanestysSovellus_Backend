## Testing steps with Postman: 

Go to postman website or download the Postman agent from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

Entering the website you should see an option to send a new api request, under the "Getting started" tab

## Registering an user

1. **Create a New Request**: Click on the "New" button and select "Request".

2. **Name the Request**: Name it "Register user" or however you like.

3. **Change the authorization type**: Make sure to change Auth type to "Bearer Token"

4. **Select Method and URL**: Set the method to `POST` and the URL to `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register`.

5. **Set Headers**: Add a header with `Content-Type: application/json`.
    
6. **Set Body**: Select the "Body" tab, choose "raw" and set the type to `JSON`. Add the following JSON:

Example:

    {
        "username": "user1",
        "password": "testing"  
    }

If you want to register as an admin, simply add this:

    {
        "username": "user1",
        "password": "testing",
        "role": "admin"
    }


## Logging in

1. **Change the URL to:** `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login`

And now login with the newly registered user
```
   {
        "username": "user1",
        "password": "testing"  
    }
```


After successfully loggin in, you will be given a token

(Keep in mind that tokens have a 1hour expiration, so if you get errors like invalid token, it most likely means the token has expired )

## Creating a poll (Admin Only)

After logging in as an admin, follow these steps to create a poll

1. **Change the URL to:** `http://localhost:5000/api/polls/` 

2. Go to the **Authorization** tab and paste the token you were given after logging in.

3. **Type in the poll**

Example:

    { 
        "question": "Whats your favoourite car brand?",
        "options": [
        { "name": "Toyota" },
        { "name": "Audi" },
        { "name": "Saab" }
        ]
    }

After successfully creating a poll, your console should look like this:

(Keep in mind the ids shown here are just examples, in reality the ids are much longer)

    {
    "message": "Poll created successfully",
    "poll": {
        "question": "Whats your favoourite car brand?",
        "options": [
            {
                "name": "Toyota",
                "votes": 0,
                "_id": "optionId1"
            },
            {
                "name": "Audi",
                "votes": 0,
                "_id": "optionId2"
            },
            {
                "name": "Saab",
                "votes": 0,
                "_id": "optionId3"
            }
        ],
        "createdBy": "admins userId",
        "votedBy": [],
        "_id": "pollId",
        "createdAt": "2024-12-04T21:54:48.397Z",
        "updatedAt": "2024-12-04T21:54:48.397Z",
        "__v": 0
    }
}


## Voting on a poll (User only)

(Make sure you have set the bearer token in the **Authorization** tab after logging in as an user)

1. **Change the URL to:** `http://localhost:5000/api/polls/pollId/vote`

2. Type in the following if you want to vote Toyota, the first option

```
{
    "optionId": "optionId1"
}   
```


After successfully voting, your console should look like this:
```
    {
    "message": "Vote recorded",
    "poll": {
        "_id": "pollId",
        "question": "Whats your favoourite car brand?",
        "options": [
            {
                "name": "Toyota",
                "votes": 1,
                "_id": "optionId1"
            },
            {
                "name": "Audi",
                "votes": 0,
                "_id": "optionId2"
            },
            {
                "name": "Saab",
                "votes": 0,
                "_id": "optionId3"
            }
        ],
        "createdBy": "admins userId",
        "votedBy": [
            "userId"
        ],
        "createdAt": "2024-12-04T09:35:13.988Z",
        "updatedAt": "2024-12-04T21:42:32.772Z",
        "__v": 1
    }
}
```
Voting again with the same user is not possible, resulting with this message if attempted:

```
{
    "message": "You have already voted on this poll"
}
```
